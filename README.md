# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis:
  The purpose of this analysis was to use SQL to breakdown data and find how many of their employees are retiring. Within the first query we determined first, last, position, and start/end dates. We filtered through duplicates, we counted the total of each position title retiring, and totaled who all are eligible for mentorship. We demonstrated how effective one page of SQL coding can give us significant information and operate a multimillion-dollar company.
  
## Results:
-	The number of retiring employees by title
-	People retiring with their current titles.
-	Total number of people retiring by title
-	Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
At first glance there are enough qualifiying mentors to train the next group of employees but one position has no eligible mentors, to function the company would need to find someone to fill the manager mentor position since there are none.
