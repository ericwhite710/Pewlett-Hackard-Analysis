# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:
  The purpose of this analysis was to use SQL to breakdown data and find how many of their employees are retiring. Within the first query we determined first, last, position, and start/end dates. We filtered through duplicates, we counted the total of each position title retiring, and totaled who all are eligible for mentorship. We demonstrated how effective one page of SQL coding can give us significant information and operate a multimillion-dollar company.
  
## Results:
  
-	The number of retiring employees by title
-	People retiring with their current titles.
-	Total number of people retiring by title
-	Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program
## Summary:
